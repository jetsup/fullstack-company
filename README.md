# README

Both `backend` and `frontend` have instructions associated with them in their respective `README.md` files.

To run the docker files included in the backend and frontend directory, use the [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) file run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will build both frontend and backend containers and run them.
